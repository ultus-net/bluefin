-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
REPLACE THIS ENTIRE SECTION WITH YOUR ACTUAL PUBLIC KEY
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

⚠️  IMPORTANT: This is a placeholder file. You must replace it with your own public key.

How to Generate and Add Your Public Key:
=========================================

1. Generate a key pair locally (NOT on GitHub):
   $ cosign generate-key-pair
   
   This creates two files:
   - cosign.key  (private key - NEVER commit this!)
   - cosign.pub  (public key - commit this to your repository)

2. Add the private key to GitHub Secrets:
   - Go to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: SIGNING_SECRET
   - Value: Paste the ENTIRE contents of cosign.key
   - Click "Add secret"

3. Update this file:
   - Open the cosign.pub file generated in step 1
   - Copy its ENTIRE contents (including BEGIN/END markers)
   - Replace this ENTIRE file with that content
   - Commit and push the change

4. Your next build will sign images automatically!

⚠️  Security Notes:
   - Key generation happens OUTSIDE of GitHub (on your local machine)
   - NEVER commit cosign.key - it's already in .gitignore
   - Only the public key (cosign.pub) should be in the repository
   - The private key (SIGNING_SECRET) stays in GitHub Secrets
